Our recruitment process has essentially the following steps:

1. **Profile Analysis:** focusing on analyzing the candidate's experience, matching it with the required level of experience and necessary skills for the job. This stage mainly consists of analyzing resumes.
2. **Phone Screening:** to focus on initial details that are indispensable for the candidate to hold.
3. **People Interview:** the purpose of this stage is to explore deeper, with a set of behavioural questions, the candidate's fit with our culture, and explain other details about the organization and position.
4. **Hiring Manager Interview:** the hiring manager will conduct this interview and will be the candidate's leader in Rocket.Chat if hired. The purpose of the interview is to assess the candidate's experience and skills to determine whether or not they would be a valuable addition to the organization, as well as to gauge their compatibility with the team in the area.

**Important:** Technical skills for specific positions may be evaluated through a technical challenge stage, which may include role play, live coding or a technical interview with the expert team.

5. **Final Interview:** The final step of the process includes a conversation with the department's executive in charge. The objective is to comprehend the applicant's motivations, answer their questions, and provide them with an overview of what to expect as a Rocketeer. The discussion is intended to be informative and interesting for the candidate.
6. **Reference Check:** Reference checks are a crucial component of the hiring process, providing employers with valuable insights into a candidate's past performance and character. This step involves contacting individuals who have worked closely with the candidate in previous roles, such as former supervisors or colleagues, to gather information about their work ethic, skills, and professionalism.
