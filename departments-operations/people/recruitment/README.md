### How We Hire: Everything You Need to Know About Our Selection Process

We've crafted our selection process to not only be organized but also humanized. Our primary objective is to ensure that candidates feel empowered, confident, and well-informed at every step of the way. In this piece, we will provide you with all that you need to know about our hiring process and offer some tips on how you can prepare for our interviews.

1. **Stay Connected: Follow Us on LinkedIn**

We regularly post about new opportunities, company updates, and insights into our culture and values at [Rocket.Chat‚Äôs page on LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/company/rocket-chat). If you haven't already, consider hitting the follow button to ensure you don't miss out on any exciting career prospects.

_And here's the best tip yet:_ even if you haven't found the perfect role for you, you can still express your interest in working at Rocket.Chat without applying for a specific position. Utilize LinkedIn's "I'm interested" feature, located in [Rocket.Chat's Life tab](http://linkedin.com/company/rocket-chat/life/). Rest assured, this information is visible only to our recruiters and won't be publicly shared. üòâ

2. **After You Apply: What to Expect?**

Firstly, we're delighted that you're considering joining our global team! Once we receive your application, our team will review your profile, aligning it with the required level of experience and necessary skills for the role.

Our application screening process typically takes a few days, but in some cases, it may extend to a few weeks. Regardless of the outcome, we believe in maintaining transparent communication and will promptly update you on the progress of your application.

‚≠ê It's crucial to emphasize that not being chosen in a specific process doesn't lessen the worth of your profile. We understand that many factors, beyond just experience, influence how well-suited a candidate is for a particular role. Your application holds significant value for us, and we'll keep your information securely stored in our database. Should future opportunities align more closely with your profile, we'll proactively reach out to you. Your interest in joining our team means a lot to us, and we're genuinely excited about the possibility of collaborating in the future.

3. **The Next Steps**

All the details about the steps will be shared with you, in case you move forward in our selection process. But, on the next page of this handbook, you can check what our external recruitment looks like.&#x20;

### üöÄ Now that you know everything about our selection process, here are some important tips for you to be prepared for it:

* Review the job description;
* Take time to learn about our company, and consider why you‚Äôd like to be a part of it. [In our handbook, especially in the ‚ÄúOur Culture‚Äù section](https://handbook.rocket.chat/), you can find a lot of important information about us and our work environment;
* Think about your strengths, your experiences, real examples, and your motivation to apply to the position. This helps you be prepared for the questions and also feel more confident about your answers;
* Interviews are not one-way roads. So, if you have any questions about the role and the company, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask them;
* We usually use Google Meet for our interviews. If possible, try to open the link 5 minutes before the meeting to test your camera and microphone;
* We know that unexpected situations can happen. So, if you‚Äôre not able to participate on the scheduled date, please let us know and we will rearrange the interview.
